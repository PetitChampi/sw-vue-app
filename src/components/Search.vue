  // I made attempts here, using a custom event, two-way data binding and a computed property for the search results.
  // I haven't been succesful due to lack of time (and a bit of confusion).

  // It would also have been possible for me to implement filter search with vehicle classes for example, which I chose to not implement due to lack of time.
